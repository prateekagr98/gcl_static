              <p class="section__text">
                It seems like the entire human race is working round the clock in the pursuit of wealth creation. As we work with present-day leaders, we are increasingly seeing their stress levels at an all-time high – testing their executive endurances, sleeping less hours & allowing work to permeate all levels of their existence, and getting lost in the maze of distractions that envelopes all our lives today.
              </p>
              <p class="section__text">
                Seeing such trends, makes us believe that wealth creation/financial success is a leading indicator of our evolution today. Using a rational lens you would think that when someone is working very hard, they deserve the financial success and wealth – this thinking is not not correct.
              </p>
              <p class="section__text">
                With financial success, the next rational question that springs forward is the question of sustenance and meaning behind it. While finding this meaning, we see some of the world’s wealthiest people channel their wealth towards causes that can constructively transform human evolution. Instead of joining the list of one-off acts of pursuits of wealth, we believe that every individual has the potential to meaningfully connect their internal and external wealth. This possibility has pushed us to create a unique offering for individuals and professionals to address the gap between their mindless financial success and their purpose driven financial success.

        <p class="section__text u-cushion-t">
          My association with Tripura Multinational and Global Coaching Lab started at the foothills of
          the Niligiri hills, when I first met Sripriyaa and Venkat in a train journey from Coimbatore to
          Hyderabad.  I would have never in my dreams thought that a short train journey would create
          such an impact on my life so positively. I was a high school student at that time at the
          Lawrence School, Lovedale and both Venkat and Priya are highly qualified and successful
          professionals. Our lives were parallel, if not for that journey on those parallel rail tracks,
          we would never cross paths and I wouldn’t have had these great opportunities in life. During
          that journey, we spoke about everything under the sun and I could instantly connect with their
          thoughts and aspirations, as I believed that they were on their way to make it big. We
          exchanged contact information and stayed in touch even after.
        </p>
        <p class="section__text">
          Our professional association really started when I reached out them one fine day in the hot
          summers of Andhra in the year 2014 to help me find an internship.  Within a week, they
          reverted with an email and offered an internship at Tripura Multinational as a market
          research intern for 2 months. I was given research projects on understanding the customer
          pulse and market needs and requirements at that time. This project provided me with an
          opportunity to interact with the key stakeholders of the company including customers,
          employees and the potential customers. This was when I realized that communication was not
          just interaction but a process that was much bigger than that and I learned to draw insights
          from a 2-minute conversation – asking the right questions, optimizing the time with posing
          questions that bring a lot of insight and value. These two months flew away quickly and it was
          time for me to return to Ohio for college and they offered me a remote internship where I
          could continue to work on projects while I continue my full-time coursework.
        </p>
        <p class="section__text">
          The fall of 2014 I took up the role of a Business analyst at Global coaching Lab and worked on
          several projects. The internship program was designed in a way where I would focus on project
          and each assignment required different set of skills and thinking style. For instance, given
          my heavy quantitative background, I was assigned to do comparative studies for GCL where I
          gather the competitors in market, evaluate the business and draw some comparisons between
          these companies. This project helped me translate qualitative information into quantitative
          for the sake of understanding and interpretation. On the other hand I was asked to work on a
            marketing project where I was required to draw advertising and promotional strategies for
          the upcoming Leadership programs.
        </p>
        <p class="section__text">
          The other biggest advantage add on during this internship program was mentorship, you are
          offered a white-glove approach in training new interns. New ideas and innovation was always
          encouraged and teams worked in harmony as a one huge family that was pacing to achieve
          greater heights and bring a purpose and meaning to all lives around.  You are encouraged to
          learn new tools and one such was Ubalancer. This tool is designed to help you realize the
          gap between your potential and your actual yield. This also helps in scheduling a work-life
          balance and segments your life in a more orderly fashion. Sripriyaa, my mentor used this
          amazing platform to help me set goals and reach them as well. This tool helped realize the
          importance of time and how we all live under the impression that we are utilizing it
          effectively but much of it goes in chores that really don’t need so much time spent on.
        </p>
        <p class="section__text">
          These projects I worked on as an intern at TM and GCL, stretched me to think, were challenging
          but I acquired some skills that were life skills. As a fulltime employee now, I am easily
          adaptive into teams, I am more effective with communication and of course I am more
          confident as an individual and a professional. As a Customer Success Lead, on a daily basis,
          I interact with hundreds of customers so effective communication is definitely the key. In
          short, TM and GCL enhanced the skills that I already had and helped me acquire newer skills
          that I wouldn’t have otherwise if not for these challenging projects and ambitious and
          helpful people around you.
        </p>
        <p class="section__text">
          Now, I understand why those parallel lives met that day years ago, it was for a larger reason
          and I would forever be grateful for the opportunity with this great brand.

          It was in 2014, when I was a first year student of communication design in DJ Academy of
          Design, Coimbatore, that I started working with Tripura Multinational and Global Coaching Lab.
          I was absolutely thrilled and excited about getting to do some creative work alongside college
          curriculum. Being a part of this team, has given me a good insight into how it is to work in
          the industry. In addition to gaining a platform to directly apply my learnings from college,
          and honing my skills as a graphic designer and an illustrator, I got a peek into, what I
          would need to equip myself with, in order to become a professional. During my internship, I
          got an opportunity to interact with people of varied interests. I learnt about the importance
          of presentation, deadlines and how people collaborate across time zones which I could
          immediately implement in my college work in subsequent years, especially when it came to my
          jury presentations, wherein I would have to take my jury panel through an entire semester’s
          work in a given timeframe.

        <p class="section__text">
          My experience here helped me to understand the client’s perspective and expectations. It also
          encouraged me to be bold and express my opinion and take the client through my understanding
          and translation of the idea into an end result that was mutually rewarding. This gave me an
          immeasurable sense of fulfillment, as I realized that I can make a difference and contribute
          positively to the company and work.

        <p class="section__text">
          Sripriyaa has mentored me and made me realize my potential. I should say that she saw what I
          was capable of, much before I could see myself doing such work. She coaxed me to stretch
          myself when in doubt and has always encouraged me to be experimental and think out of the
          box. I really enjoyed the process of brainstorming for the concepts, discussing ideas and
          opinions and looking at it from different angles. It was indeed a vital experience.
